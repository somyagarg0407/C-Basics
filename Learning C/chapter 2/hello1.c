// ##use variable before using it 

/* like
int a=b=c=1 is wrong because b and c not konown  first and in this like x=y=z case valuues assign form right to left
but
inta=1,b=1,c=1; is correct


but 
int a,b,c;
a=b=c=1  is right
 
 ########## pow(a,b)  for a is to the power b but for this add  #include<math.h> below stdio.h

to find the remainder use a%b for rem. when a divided by b but not use float value


when we do 3/2 in int manner we get the resulrt only 1 means that for int it simply removes the decimal values
